Overview : Created a 3D scene with Blender software. The scene is representing a gaming room/university student room.
           Materials that were used are : 1) Displacement mapping 2) Bump mapping 3) High reflectivity 4) Transparency.
           Furthermore, the scene also has 2 different animations, one with keyframes and one with physics.
           Lastly, I have also put fog and different light sources, to make my render more realistic.
